  "summary": "Diff adds an IC asset canister headers config file and updates two project/meta summary files, but does not provide verifiable deployment documentation, SPA deep-link fallback behavior, or backend deployment readiness changes required by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add production deployment documentation explaining how to deploy to IC mainnet (prereqs, build steps, `dfx deploy --network ic`, and how to get live URL(s)).",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any new or modified deployment guide (e.g., DEPLOYMENT.md/README). The only added functional file is an assets headers config; the mention of DEPLOYMENT.md appears only inside a summary/metadata file, not as an actual file change.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions DEPLOYMENT.md but no DEPLOYMENT.md file is added/modified in diff list)",
        "<file-diff> Added files list only includes frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure clean production build path and SPA routing compatibility on IC assets canister (deep links/refresh do not 404).",
      "reason": "While an IC assets config file was added, its shown content only sets cache/content-type headers and does not demonstrate SPA deep-link fallback (e.g., serving index.html for unknown routes). There are also no build-related config changes shown (vite/webpack/router/base path) to support production builds on IC.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5 (content shows only headers rules; no explicit SPA fallback behavior shown)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Confirm backend canister deployment readiness (Motoko compiles and deploys to mainnet without candid/config errors).",
      "reason": "No backend files (e.g., backend/main.mo, dfx.json, canister interface config) are added or modified in the diff, so there is no evidence of ensuring backend build/deploy readiness.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff> Modified files list contains no backend/* files",

        "project_state.json"

    },
    {
      "description": "Frontend change summaries added/updated in frontend-file-summaries.txt.",
